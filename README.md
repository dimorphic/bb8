# Star Wars BB8 + Xbox controller + Myo
#### The droid you're looking for!

Control your [Sphero Star Wars BB8](http://www.sphero.com/starwars) droid with a [Xbox 360 controller](http://www.xbox.com/xbox-360/accessories/controllers/wireless-controller) (wireless) !

Or, is ***The Force*** strong enough in you? If you have a [Myo](http://myo.com) armband, you can use commands such as `Force Push` or `Force Turn` (more to come) to control your BB8 droid as a Jedi or Sith master! (PS: I haz cookies!)

That's it, folks!
